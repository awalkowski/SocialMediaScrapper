This is my portfolio

# NOTE
This is my first git hub project so if syntax and practices seem weird i apologize
IMPORTANT: You must create a twitter_credentials.py file to be in the same directory as social_media_scrapper.py
    *this file must include the following 
#Variables that contains the user credentials to access Twitter API
ACCESS_TOKEN = string i.e "129360556635802370-FL7DV89dfpfyx7TFlQMGVHYTllLNXTx"
ACCES_TOKEN_SECRET = string i.e "8dlGrS9PT2mNhPSYz2ccbfidJP7HHNzgxxum07Vg7WWkG8"
CONSUMER_KEY = string i.e "arrJ66AFAGF3S1LbZi6xWtrrR"
CONSUMER_SECRET = string i.e "nShP21TOEYAgcWSdaZYjpCx6YxM3LcVxbvMUxl5fgtQeUwn"
All of these values will come from the twitter API website when configuring your own API credentials.
